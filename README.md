# Flask based application to Detect Parkinsons's Disease
 The flask based helps us to upload spiral and wave images of the patients, then it uses HOG(HIstogram of Oriented Gradients) to extract features of the image and later on these features are passed on to Random Forest Clasifier for image classification into Parkinson's or Healthy Image of patients.
